Coming from a much heavier background in MATLAB and R, learning Python was a massive headache for me at first. Most existing Python tutorials aren’t really written for us data scientists, but for software developers who already understands the basics. All I wanted was to use Python the way I used RStudio, without being bombarded by wave after wave of new terminology.

I want to share some of my learnings and frustrations here, along with more data-oriented tutorials that I hope will help others who have the same needs.
