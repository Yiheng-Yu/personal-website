As someone came from a much heavier background of Matlab and R, learning python has been a massive headache for me in the past. Most of the existing tutorials for python aren't build for us data scientists, but targeted for software developer and computer scientists. I just want do be able to do things in python like that of R studio, without getting bombarded with waves and waves of new terminologies! I want to share some of my learnings as well as the frustrations here.
