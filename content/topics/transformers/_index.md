I find lots of available introductions on transformers very confusing.

Finally, I've decided to bite the bullet and spend some time have a read through the HuggingFace's source code for many of these models, [like this one](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/t5/modeling_t5.py). I took lots of notes here and there during the process of studying transformers.<br>

This series of blogposts collects my notes and ELI5s of what I've learned, hope these notes can help others alongside their studying, or being interesting little pieces of articles to read through.
